# spectral operator learning
Here you find the **S**pectral **O**perator **L**earning **U**nder construc**TION**


It's the code for the paper:
- [Render unto Numerics : Orthogonal Polynomial Neural Operator for PDEs with Non-periodic Boundary Conditions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.12698)

The datasets are now available below
- [dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YLsK5GkFpRvrUI4olSEBaz1Jo7T7lO0C?usp=sharing)
except the full dataset for heat-Robin-BC experiment with full (8192+1) resolution and all (10^6) samples,  the file size being 27G. If you need the full heat-robin dataset please contact us via email. And thanks for my friend Hui Zhong helping me uploading the datasets.
