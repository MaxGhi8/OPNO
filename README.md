Here you find the Spectral Operator Learning Under construcTION


It's the code for the paper:
- [Render unto Numerics : Orthogonal Polynomial Neural Operator for PDEs with Non-periodic Boundary Conditions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.12698)

in which we clarify the idea why should and how the operator learning methods satisfy the boundary condition of PDEs precisely. However, it's a pity that more numerical experiments are now in process, and if you are familiar with the application of spectral galerkin methods, or have any idea and suggestion, please do not hesitate to contact us by liuziyuan17@nudt.edu.cn.
